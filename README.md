## Description
This project is to create a readme generator using prompt questions in the command line. Each question will create different sections of the readme. In this readme we want to display a title, license with badge, table of contents, description, installation, usage, contributors, test, and questions. The table of contents will link to the different sections of the readme. When a specific license choice is made it will show at the top of the readme under the title with a badge. Under the questions section when the user inputs there GitHub username it with create a link to their GitHub account. When the user puts in their email address it with create a link to their email.
